## Welcome!

We love all friendly contributions.

Before we merge your hard work, you will need to also sign a document stating that you freely give all copyright over to this project for any submitted pull requests.

Some of the items we will check when you submit a pull request are
* Does the pull request follow the style of the rest of the project?
* Do all the tests and other code quality checks still pass?
* Does the pull request maintain the same level of code coverage?
* If adding new functionality, were test cases added for the base case and several edge cases?
* Was documentation updated (if applicable)?

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt), and its [README](README.md).

If you have any questions just [shoot us an email](mailto:john.scancella@gmail.com).
